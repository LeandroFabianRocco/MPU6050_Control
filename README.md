# Using the FRDM-K64F magnetometer-accelerometer and receiving data from a MPU6050
 
This project have the scripts to adquire data from the Magnetometer/Accelerometer FXOS8700CQ and the Accelerometer/Gyroscope data of a MPU6050 board.

The objective of this project is not only adquire data but also filtering the data and obtaing attitude calculations from it to control a Quadcopter.

Project Status
* Accelerometer and magnetometer data from FXOS8700CQ is received. Library was created.
* Communication with MPU6050 was stablished (WHO_AM_I reg was read)
